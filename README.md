# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Random Potion generator

This App was thought up while playing a game of D&D.

Choosing a potion based on rarity, this app randomly generates a potion and assigns it a random percentage chance to succeed. The percentage for a success is based on a range given proficiancy and rarity.
